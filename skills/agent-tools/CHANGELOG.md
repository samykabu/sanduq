# Changelog

## 1.1.1 — 2026-09-27

- Fix sandboxed Codex continuation by placing exec options before the resume subcommand (B6).
- Add an end-to-end fake-harness test that rejects misplaced sandbox options.
- Keep the driver and result schemas unchanged; this is an argument-order fix.

## 1.1.0 â€” 2026-09-26

- Add the machine-readable `delegate-task.driver.v1` contract for workflow
  integration, including requested and observed model fields.
- Make the driver entry point work when the skill is installed through a
  symlinked folder.
- Keep run status and measured file changes explicit in the result contract;
  172 driver tests pass.

## 1.0.0
