"""Lint diagram examples as *rendered* — catches breakage the source can't show.

``lint-skin.py`` reads the HTML. This one renders it in headless Chromium and
asks the browser what actually got painted, so it catches content cut off by the
SVG viewport, collapsed SVGs, sideways page overflow and runtime errors.

How the clipping check works
---------------------------
Chromium's ``getBoundingClientRect()`` on an SVG child reports *geometry*, not
paint: it excludes stroke width, markers and filter bleed (so a 40px stroke
spilling past the viewport measures as inside), and it ignores ``clip-path``,
``opacity: 0`` ancestors and ``overflow: visible`` (so safe content measures as
outside). Both directions were reproduced in Chromium, so no geometry model is
used here.

Instead the browser is the oracle: screenshot the viewport as authored,
screenshot it again with ``overflow`` released, and diff the two. New ink means
paint was being cut off — ink is ink, so strokes, markers and filter bleed all
count, while clip-path, invisible and already-visible content produce no new ink.

Releases are **staged**, because a diagram can be clipped at more than one level
and each release repaints its own box:

- stage 0 releases the SVG alone, and looks for ink outside the SVG's box;
- stage *k* also releases the *k* nearest clipping ancestors, and looks for ink
  outside the outermost released box.

Without staging, releasing an ancestor masks spill just outside the SVG (its box
becomes part of the ignored area), and an SVG authored ``overflow: visible``
inside a clipping wrapper looks clean while the wrapper cuts it off.

What the diff ignores, and why:

- The outermost released box for that stage. A released element repaints itself —
  an ``overflow: hidden`` box with a ``border-radius`` loses its rounded corners —
  which is not spill.
- An ``EDGE_GUARD``-px band around it, and anything under ``MIN_DIFF_PIXELS``
  pixels past ``CHANNEL_THRESHOLD``. Releasing ``overflow`` re-antialiases
  boundary pixels by a channel step or two, which is not a clipped diagram.

Every stage runs at each of ``DIFF_SCALES``: 1x resolves spill of a few px, 0.25x
pulls spill up to four viewports wide back into frame. All geometry stays in one
coordinate system — viewport pixels, straight from ``getBoundingClientRect()``,
matching ``page.screenshot()`` — so an SVG below the fold measures the same as
one above it.

Known ceilings: spill of ~2px or less, spill past 0.25x framing, and SVGs inside
a *scrolling* ancestor, which report ``unmeasurable`` rather than passing quietly.

Every property this script mutates is snapshotted and restored verbatim in a
``finally``, and ``--self-test`` asserts the DOM is byte-identical afterwards.

Trust boundary
--------------
This renders contributor HTML in a real browser with JavaScript enabled, so treat
it like opening the file yourself. Network is cut at the resolver
(``--host-resolver-rules``), which also stops WebSockets and anything else that
does not go through Playwright's request routing, with request routing as a second
layer. ``--fonts`` excludes exactly the two Google Fonts hostnames from the
resolver block and allows them only over HTTPS on an exact hostname match.
``--self-test`` proves the isolation against a local listener.

One check sits outside that browser: ``--all`` and ``--self-test`` run the PNG
rasterize snippet from ``references/export.md`` in a subprocess, the way the doc
tells a user to, on local fixtures (the shipped templates re-drawn at a wide
preset, with every remote ``<link>`` removed). That subprocess's Chromium is not
under the resolver block, which is why the fixtures carry no remote references.

Because the oracle is pixels, CI must pin Playwright and its bundled Chromium
rather than taking whatever is newest.

Run from the skill directory:

    python scripts/lint-render.py --all
    python scripts/lint-render.py assets/example-venn.html
    python scripts/lint-render.py --self-test   # proves every check still fires

Ported from diagram-design (MIT). Illustrate deviation: the gallery (index.html)
mobile-routing check is not ported, because Illustrate's gallery is its own page;
the Excalidraw mobile check runs only when example-import-excalidraw.html exists.
No colour is read anywhere, so the checks are theme-neutral and apply equally to
`illustration_theme.py apply` output.

Requires Playwright (same dev dependency the PNG export uses):

    pip install playwright && playwright install chromium
