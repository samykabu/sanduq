"""Adversarial cases for verify-streamgraph.py, both polarities.

Every case is named for exactly what it asserts, and the negative half matters
as much as the positive: a checker that fires on an honest pinch-to-zero, on
honest rounding, or on the other shipped example types gets widened or switched
off, and then it guards nothing.

Fixtures are built from the same math the shipped example uses - a symmetric
baseline, one shared scale, Catmull-Rom boundaries at 1/6 chord - so a mutation
breaks exactly the invariant its case names. Fixtures live in a per-process
temporary directory; two cases at the end hold that isolation in place.

Exit: 0 all pass, 1 any failure.
