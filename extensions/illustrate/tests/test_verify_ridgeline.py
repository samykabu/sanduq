"""Adversarial tests for verify-ridgeline.py — both polarities.

Per ADR 0005, a geometric contract is a checker plus fixtures proving it fires
when it should and stays quiet when it shouldn't. Each mutation below renders
perfectly and no other gate would catch it: one ridge drawn on its own
amplitude, a baseline nudged off the pitch to buy headroom, a spline through
binned counts, a printed range wider than the mass it claims, a name label
sitting on a neighbour's row.

The synthetic figures at the end prove the checker reads the FIGURE's own
amplitude and pitch rather than memorising the shipped layout: a valid ridgeline
at a different top, pitch and scale must pass, and the budget rules must fire at
BOTH ends on counts the shipped example cannot be mutated into.

The parsing cases hold the checker to reading markup as a browser does: a
quoted `>` inside an attribute does not end the tag, a repeated attribute keeps
its first value, a comment is never live markup, and a transform is refused on
all three of its carriers (attribute, inline style, <style> rule) — each in
both polarities, so an honest figure written the odd way still passes.

The last case pins the scope treaty with the sibling Line-variant checkers.
`data-bins` on a `<path>` is this contract's vocabulary; `data-series`,
`data-ranks` and `data-layer` belong to the slopegraph, bump and streamgraph
gates. Every sibling checker present in the tree is handed the ridgeline
examples directly and must skip them without a word — a sibling that claimed one
would reject it for lacking elements it never said it had. The reverse direction
is asserted too: this checker must skip the siblings' shipped examples.

Usage: python scripts/test-verify-ridgeline.py
Exit: 0 all pass, 1 a case failed.
